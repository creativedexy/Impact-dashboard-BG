# Benefact Group Impact Calculator

An interactive web application that demonstrates how insurance premiums create measurable community impact through Benefact Group's unique charity-owned business model.

## 🎯 About This Project

This calculator was designed as part of a strategic campaign concept called "More Than Giving" to showcase Benefact Group's regenerative business model where 100% of profits go to charitable giving.

### Key Features

- **Interactive Impact Calculator**: Users input their insurance type, premium, and postcode to see potential community impact
- **Business Portfolio Showcase**: Highlights which Benefact Group business they'd work with
- **Transparent Profit Flow**: Shows how premiums become profits, then charitable giving
- **Multiplier Effect Visualization**: Demonstrates the £37.50 economic return per £1 invested in charity capacity building
- **Local Impact**: Displays estimated number of charities supported in their area
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

## 💡 The Concept

This tool transforms insurance from a grudge purchase into a purposeful choice by showing customers:

1. **Which specialist business** they'd work with
2. **How their premium** contributes to profit
3. **How profit is invested** in direct grants + capacity building
4. **The multiplier effect** of blended giving (money + skills + resources)
5. **Local charities** they'd help support

## 🎨 Design

**Brand Colours:**
- Primary: Emerald Green (#009B77)
- Accent: Gold (#C9A961)
- Background: White with subtle gradients
- Text: Dark Teal (#004D40)

**Design Philosophy:**
- Premium financial services aesthetic
- Trustworthy and transparent
- Data-driven but warm
- Clean, minimal, lots of white space

## 📊 The Model

**Based on Real Research:**

- £250m+ donated since 2014

Investment Breakdown:
  → 40% Direct Grants (£147)
  → 35% Capacity Building (£128)
  → 15% Infrastructure (£55)
  → 10% Administration (£37)
         ↓
Multiplier Effect (Training generates £37.50 per £1)
